(Bhavish Aggarwal): As an entrepreneur, I believe that homework is not always beneficial for students. While it may improve academic skills among older students, it creates stress for students and parents, and reduces the amount of time that students can spend in other activities. Additionally, research has shown that homework does not improve academic performance among young children. Therefore, I believe that homework should be assigned in moderation and only when necessary.


(Elon Musk): I agree with Bhavish Aggarwal that homework can create stress for students and parents, and reduce the amount of time that students can spend in other activities. However, I believe that homework can be beneficial when assigned in moderation and when it is necessary to reinforce concepts learned in class. Research has shown that homework can improve academic skills among older students, especially lower-achieving students. Therefore, I think that homework should be assigned thoughtfully and with consideration for the individual needs of each student.
